list of updates for run23_testing:

1. set up new script (using use_allCloudnetData_variable for guidance) for quick MONC output tests (need code that appends files together to do quick quality checks on output before comparing with UM/obs)
2. basic tests: mean theta profiles at beginning/end of run and at checkpoint restart
3. timeseries of cloud liquid mass mixing ratio, cloud ice mixing ratio, and total ice (ice+snow+graupel) number concentration
4. mark 8h on quickplot timeseries - new spin up location
5. update naming convention: number = spin up reference; letter = run config using given spin up. valid from run 26 onwards.
6. include split comparison of mean cloud droplet number concentration
6. include split comparison of mean ice number concentration. ice+snow+graupel for MONC.
